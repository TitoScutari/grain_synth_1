# grain_synth_1
Granular synthesizer, made with max
grantest3 is the most advanced version of the patch at the moment. The first preset in the table should work straight away. It has also presentation mode that has everything that is needed to perform, envelope updating is sometimes buggy but most of the time envelope udates when the function is modified. Live fader is the reverb, not the best one but it works, inside the patch you cn also easily tweak the panning function.

- B1 is the buffer with the sample that is being played
- W1 is the envelope buffer, click on the envelope if you see it empty when starting up everything
- Probably you have to crank up the reverb mix when you open the patch, preset doesnt seem to affect it
- playing around with pows changes the range of the pitch shifting and speed, can be interesting but to me 3 is fine most of the times
- Some mapping for the arturia minilab MK1 is included
